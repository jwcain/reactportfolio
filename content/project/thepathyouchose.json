  "description": "The Path you Chose is a Non-Euclidean 2D Line drawing game. Non-Euclidean, in this sense, means that many of the rooms and spaces do not connect in ways that you expect. I worked primarily on the rendering code, more specifically Game Manager, Rendering Handler, and Rendering Tile, but as the team leader I assisted development with most code throughout the project.",
