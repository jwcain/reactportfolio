      "description": "In a large enough bowl to hold the full recipe, whisk dry ingredients together. Then, add peanut butter to dry ingredients. Name brand is preferred as they typically have more emulsifiers that help in the baking process, natural peanut butters will be me oily. Using a clean hand, crumble/press the dry mixture and peanut butter together until you get a loose dough-like mixture similar in texture to wet sand. Set aside to rest.",
